\# Quiz 14 – Auto-generated API



\## Tool Used



\- \*MockAPI\* – https://mockapi.io  

\- MockAPI automatically generates a REST API from a resource schema defined in a web UI. No backend code is required.



\## Steps I Followed



1\. Went to https://mockapi.io and created an account.

2\. Created a new project named \*\*`quiz14-api`\*\* with an API prefix of `/api/v1`.

3\. Created a new resource named \*\*`students`\*\* with the following schema:

&nbsp;  - `id` – Object ID (auto-generated by MockAPI)

&nbsp;  - `name` – String

&nbsp;  - `email` – String

4\. Used the \*\*Resource data\*\* editor to seed data for the `students` resource. I started with a few manual records (e.x. Alice and Bob) and then used MockAPI’s generator to create a total of \*\*50 student records\*\*.

5\. MockAPI automatically generated REST endpoints for this resource with the base URL:
